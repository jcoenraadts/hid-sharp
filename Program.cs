         * This demo code returns the details of all connected HID devices, then selects one of them
         * and connects to it. A synchronous read / write operation is performed and the device is 
         * closed.
         * Two methods are included to show the synchronous and asynchronous operations of this software.
         * 
         * The intention of this code is to provide a demonstration which can be run in a debug
         * environment, and the sample methods can be cut and pasted into your program
         * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
